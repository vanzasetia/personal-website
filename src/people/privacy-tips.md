I like how the author does not force the readers to stop using the so-called smartphone. Instead, the author gives solutions to reduce [Big Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) surveillance.

My favorite phrase:

> Habits can be powerful.

I agree that habits are the keys to minimizing privacy invasions. I use Proton VPN whenever possible to prevent my Internet Service Provider (ISP) from tracking my browsing habits. If I do not need to log in, I use incognito windows or private tabs.

If you get a new Android, this is the first thing that you can do:

> Switch to non-surveillance apps and remove as many apps from your phone as you can.

The author uses the term "non-surveillance apps." But I say to you to use free/libre software. Go to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/). Use [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/) with the "Open Source" filter. Replace as many proprietary apps as possible with free/libre apps.

To clarify, the term "open source" does not mean the source code is available publicly. Although the source code is mostly available publicly, the focus is on the license. Also, "free software" does not mean the apps can be installed without buying. It means the [software respects your freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) through its license.

Going back to the article, I would say that the article does not go in-depth. This means if you are new to this, this article can be your starting point.

Do what you can do to limit the amount of data that Big Tech can steal from you. The more effort you put in, the fewer data being collected—or stolen. Develop habits. But do not expect to be fully invisible or unrecognizable on the Internet. No matter the device or the type of connection—Tor or VPN or both—you can not be truly anonymous. Have a realistic goal.

Any improvements you make are an attack on those privacy invaders. Protect your privacy.
