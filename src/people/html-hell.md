My favorite point from The HTML Hell Page is to always set both `color` and `background-color`. Why do you need to do that?

I believe this is something that people can easily overlook.

Also, I agree with Eric that people sometimes forget the most essential thing on the web. It is not your code. It is the content. Why does content matter?

If your website is completely compliance with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), but your website gives nothing to people, you already make your website hard to reach lots of people.

One more thing, I hate the HTML marquee elementâ€”Eric hates it too. I remember when I had to wait to see a date because it was on the marquee element. It moved quickly. I could not read it properly. Thanks to that I spent more than one minute just to read a date. (Don't tell anybody that it is a government website.)

I do not want to spoil everything. So you know what to do now.
