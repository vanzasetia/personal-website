I do not like the beginning of this post. It starts with a useless warning: "this post deals with religion and politics."

First, why do you need to put a warning? Dane, I do not understand that. Is that post going to harm people if it is about religion and politics?

Second, Christianity has nothing to do with religion. Christianity is a teaching of God. While religion is human-made like Catholicism, Protestantism, and many other things.

Dane, you need to remove that warning.

Anyway, I do not hate this post. In fact, I agree with the message of the post: A Christian is a political person.

Christians, you can not be neutral. You must go and vote. If Christians in America do not vote, a person like Joe Biden will become your next president. If you do not vote against the devil, you are supporting the devil.

Enough is enough. We—as Christians—must fight the devil.

How do we fight the devil most of the time?

> Yes, a time to speak. Clearly. Directly. Forthrightly. Unequivocally. Heroically.

Speak. Do not be silent.

Fake priests do not like politics. They allow a person like Joe Biden to be a president because they encourage people not to vote. They say politics is evil. In fact, those priests are the evil ones.

But Dane, why do you state that being non-partisan is right to a certain degree? What kind of value that you find, Dane? By being a Christian, we are affiliated with God. We side with the truth only. If Trump is dumb, we must say that [he is dumb](/blog/trump-disrespectful/). If Trump—or anybody—does the right thing, [we support him](/blog/common-sense/).

John The Baptist died because he criticized Herod. Jesus got crucified because He spoke against the Pharisees. Jesus never went neutral.

> He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

—[1 John 4:8 (King James Version)](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204:8&version=KJV)

God is not neutral. God is love. If you believe in God, you must love God and reject all anti-Christ teachings. You are either a Christian or a non-Christian. You can not be either of them at the same time.

Christians, we must always take a side. Christianity has always been about politics. If you are being neutral, you support the devil. We must actively fight the devil in any form.

If all Christians—2.4 billion people—fight the devil together, what will the world become?
