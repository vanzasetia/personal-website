I strongly agree with the following:

> Accessibility is a holistic practice that touches every aspect of creating a digital experience.

All people who are involved directly in making a product need to pay attention to its accessibility, *ideally*. I would say, "Yes, accessibility is also everybody's concern *ideally*."
