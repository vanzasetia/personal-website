When I read the article's title, I did not understand "post-psd." I searched on the internet and found out that PSD is a native format of Adobe Photoshop. Then, I was sure that "post-psd" refers to a process after designing using Adobe Photoshop.

I agree with Brad Frost that we should not use a design tool to envision the final product which is a website. A design tool does not need to cover every situation. I think a mobile view, a desktop view, and a hovered state are enough.

Also, I think that before even designing the visual look of the website, all people—such as clients, developers, and designers—need to gather and discuss the content first. Content is the king. If a website looks good, but its content is bad, users will have a bad experience—such as struggling to understand the content.

In my humble opinion, [a content-first design](https://alistapart.com/article/priority-guides-a-content-first-alternative-to-wireframes/) is preferable compared to other approaches. Last time, I improved this website significantly by making [a priority guide first](/blog/redesigning-improving/). Doing that allowed me to focus on the content. I could write without worrying about design or layout. No distractions. I was free to express my ideas.

Going back to the article, I strongly agree with the following statement:

> Use what tools you’re comfortable with, but know when those tools stop making sense.

All tools have limitations. We should not use them more than what they can do. Also, we have limitations because we are just humans. We should not make ourselves do the impossible: making every state of a website with a design tool.

Notice that Brad Frost advised us to "use what tools you're comfortable with." Do not follow what most people use because we are unique. I have my own preferences for tools to [make a website](/people/actual-website/). You may have different preferences from me and the majority. That is fine. No need to debate.

Well, I like this awesome article. It is brief and great. Have you read it?
