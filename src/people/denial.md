I use [DuckDuckGo AI chat](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=DuckDuckGo+AI+Chat&ia=chat&duckai=1) sometimes for brainstorming or paraphrasing. I do not copy-paste whatever it gives to me. But this tool helps me. Then, I learned Large Language Models (LLMs) have caused serious problems when they gather data. They have overloaded many websites. Are I and many other users of LLM part of the problem?

[Denial](https://adactio.com/journal/21831) is a denial that unethical LLM companies are the problem and the users do not necessarily support the negative effects. I would say the unethical LLM companies bear 99 percent of the responsibility, while the users bear one percent—or even less—responsibility.

Jeremy Keith wrote that the users of LLMs take part in making many great websites get overloaded.

> If you’re using the products powered by these attacks, you’re part of the problem.

Jeremy Keith, do you eat meat? If that is the case, can I say that you are supporting the abuse of farm animals? If you are using cars, you are part of the cause of oil scarcity. Do you feel bad now?

Who are you blaming people? What is your business? Now this person is the wise one.

By the way, I do not know Jeremy Keith. I think he is a great web developer. He has written some incredible books. I just do not like this particular comment.

> Don’t pretend it’s cute to ask ChatGPT for something.

Do not pretend that making something on the internet is cute. Those so-called Artificial Intelligence (AI) crawlers will eat those cute things. Do not pretend. Be real, my friend.

To my readers: "AI" is not intelligence. It is still very stupid when it comes to general knowledge. It can not even correctly answer "Do Muslims and Christians worship the same God?"

> If you’re going to use generative tools powered by large language models, don’t pretend you don’t know how your sausage is made.

Most people do not know. What do you mean by "pretending"?

As a side note, "how the sausage is made" is an idiom. It means "the practical and often unpleasant or messy aspects of a process that are usually not made public" according to [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/how%20the%20sausage%20is%20made).

Here is my point: users of LLMs have no intention make those great services go down. If they are, has Jeremy Keith ever known a person using ChatGPT to make that happen?

I understand those "AI" crawlers have caused serious problems to some websites and services. The owners of those become frustrated. I understand. No problem. I also condemn those crawlers for making great public websites to be overloaded. But blaming "AI" users is also a problem to me.
