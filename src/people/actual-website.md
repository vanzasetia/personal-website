I like the idea of having a website dedicated to sharing a philosophy for a better web. But I do not agree with the following point:

> A website should be accessible to all people, regardless of what assistive technologies they might need.

What do you mean by "all people"? Making an accessible website to all people is impossible. This website, VanzaSetia, is [inaccessible](/blog/inaccessible/) to some people. An accessible website for all people does not and will not exist. **I challenge you to prove me wrong**.

Then, it continues with "assistive technologies." This is bizarre. Assistive technologies are varies. Then, the users are also different. Next, the settings on each assistive technology can be different from one user to another user. To make things more complicated, think about the combination of the browser and the add-ons. This is like trying to sell ice cream in a dessert.

A website does not need to be accessible to all people. Instead, choose your users.

Now I like the following point:

> [â€¦] refrain from using trendy tech just because somebody else told you should use it.

Using popular technologies is not necessarily the best decision for every website and context. JavaScript is a popular programming language. But a single page website with social media links does not need JavaScript.

A legitimate question that people can ask is: how can we get a job if we do not learn those technologies? If your dream job requires you to learn and use those trendy technologies, study and use them. If you do not want to learn about them, do not apply for the job. The choice is up to you.

My stance on using popular technologies is clear: I use them if I need them. This is not about right and wrong. This is about the needs.

The developers of those popular technologies do not force people to use them. They can not and should not do that. But those developers can influence you to use their tools, and you decide to either use them or ignore them.

To end this, I say to you that a website is a place to share something to people. That can be anything. The purpose can be anything too. That is an actual website.
