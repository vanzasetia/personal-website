Sergei has debunked 22 accessibility myths.

After I read the entire thing, I remind myself that web accessibility is not only about HTML and CSS. It is also about user experience, web design, and content.

This is the biggest lie:

> Only accessibility experts can implement accessibility fixes

If web accessibility is not accessible, it already fails to give a good example. It becomes inaccessible web accessibility.

The truth is that learning web accessibility takes lots of time. You do not need an expert to fix any accessibility issues. I can prove it to you. I believe you can make sure each page only has one HTML heading one element (`<h1>`) and one HTML main element (`<main>`).

I do know there are hard accessibility issues such as dealing with many screen readers with different settings and browsers. But if you use the right HTML elements, you are already doing a great job on web accessibility.

If you are new to web accessibility, [a checklist from The A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/) is a good starting point to test your website's accessibility.

You do not need to know everything at once. Web accessibility is about gradual improvements. It is not about [perfection](/blog/inaccessible/).

Knowing about accessibility myths is also one way to learn about web accessibility.
