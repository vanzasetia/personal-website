The articles on this website encourage you to think critically. I invite you to judge whether what I write is right or wrong. Fight against intellectual laziness.

Intellectual laziness is an invisible disease that makes a person let others decide. The person is too lazy to think. In fact, the person constantly decides to let others make decisions. This disease makes the person a slave—either a society’s slave or someone else’s slave.

The articles are mainly about web development. I give you information that most tutorials do not cover. I also write on many other exciting topics about life in general from [my perspective](/author/) as a person among eight billion people on the earth.

All the articles use plain English and plain HTML. I do not like using jargon. If I must use it, I explain it clearly. I use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a static site generator, that generates plain HTML for all pages on this website.

## Motive

People are bad because they do not know the effects of their actions. They are either being fooled by evil people or are stubborn. For example, an ignorant person believes that swearing is cool. How can that happen? They do not say that using dirty words is bad. Instead, people around that person give good reactions—such as laughing. But _real_ educated people look down on that person.

People are also bad because they get the wrong idea. That means they keep doing harmful activities while believing those activities bring positive impacts. For example, making lots of projects by watching tutorial videos makes beginner developers feel satisfied and learn a lot. But, when they want to make something from scratch by themselves, they do not know what to do. In fact, they learn nothing about programming. They only learn the skill to follow tutorials. Instead, they should spend their time making projects by themselves and _only_ use tutorials when they are stuck.

Knowledge should not be locked—such as using proprietary formats, using [Digital Restrictions Management](https://drm.info/) (DRM), and using copyright law. Knowledge must have freedom. Otherwise, only people with extraordinary power can be smart.

Knowing the truth helps people be free. I want people to have their freedom. They should control their lives. The only way to get that is through knowledge.
