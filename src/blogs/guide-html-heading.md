Here are my guidelines for HTML headings in no particular order:

- Guide your users with headings. New users may not know who you are or what is on your website. Use headings to help your users navigate your website.
- Use CSS to enlarge headings. Make them big and clear enough. For `h1`, make them the largest and the boldest text on all pages. Be bold.
- Make headings visible. Visually hidden headings are not accessible for non-assistive technology users. Visible headings are always preferable.
- Make sure each heading labels the information below it.
- Use HTML headings in a logical order. Users of assistive technology can use heading tags to navigate the website. If headings are not in a logical order, the users can get confused.
- Do not skip heading levels. They must always be in chronological order to give structure to a page.
- Have one `h1` for each page. The HTML heading one element defines the main heading of a page. Having many `h1` elements may confuse assistive technology users. Users browsing with CSS disabled or in reading mode can also get confused. Instead of using many `h1` elements, use other heading elements—such as `h2`, `h3`, and `h4`—to make subheadings and to structure the information on the page.
- Do not use heading elements to make a text big and bold. Headings are used to structure page and have semantic meaning. For presentational purpose, use CSS.

Some guidelines can be applied when you structure information using a word processor.
