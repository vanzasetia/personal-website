Disable CSS, JavaScript, third-party, caching. Disable images, videos, and audio. Only texts appear in your website with user-agent style sheet. Make sure your website still survives.

If your website relies mostly on plain HTML and text, it is accessible to lots of people in cases such as on a slow internet connection or when the user's connection is lost in the middle of loading your website. It is also accessible when the users use reader mode in their browsers.
