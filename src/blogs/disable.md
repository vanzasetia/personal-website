Disable CSS. Disable JavaScript. Disable third-party. Disable caching. Disable images, videos, and audio. Only texts appear in your website with user-agent stylesheet. Make sure your website still survives.

If your website relies mostly on plain text, it is accessible to lots of people in cases such as on a slow internet connection or when the user's connection is lost in the middle of loading your website. It is also accessible when the users use reader mode in their browsers.
