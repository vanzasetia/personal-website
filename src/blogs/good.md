I do not have to be the best to be good. I do not always have to give my best to be good.

My pen is not the best, but it is useful. The laptop I use is not the best, but it works. I do not have to be the best at English to write in English.

I can survive without having the best thing.

The best is preferable but not necessary because good is enough.
