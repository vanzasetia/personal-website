Playing video games is supposed to be a fun thing, right? Strangely, not for everyone.

Some people play games as if they want to torture themselves. For instance, I know someone who is afraid of playing horror games. But this person still plays horror games anyway. This person gets scared when starting to play the game. Then, this person exits the game when this person feels there will be a jump scare. This person is weird. Another example is that I often see people gather to play an online multiplayer game. They shout like crazies. They like people with mental illness. I hate f-words. But to show you how crazy some people are when they play games, they shout, "Fuck! I am dead!" and then shout, "Argghhhh! Fuck you!" They can not control their mouth.

Do you know what is more interesting? I live near those people, at the moment. Do you want to know what is even more interesting? They shout like that at night.

Why do they play a game if they become angry? I know that anger gives power. But getting angry because of a fictional character dying is useless.

Even on YouTube, I saw many content makers recording themselves playing rage games. Why? They get lots of views. This means they get lots of money in return. Why do people like watching others get insane?

This phenomenon shows how stupid humans can be.

If you watch those kinds of videos, why do you watch them? You get nothing in return. You see people getting crazy like monkeys. Those people use bad words every two seconds. You may be influenced by those videos. There are so many videos like that on the internet, why do you watch them? I do not understand.

We need to keep our sanity. We need to stay vigilant in pursuing righteousness. We can not just let our eyes and our ears see and listen without any filter.

By the way, I play video games. But I do not play games that will trigger my anger.

There is nothing wrong with playing games. But if those games make people act like monkeys, why do they keep playing those games? I do not understand.
