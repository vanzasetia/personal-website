Shalom, everyone. Peace for those who love Christ and no peace for the wicked ones as the Lord said:

> There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

## Appearing as a pastor

I know that not all Christians who say that "I am a Christian" are Christians. Some are even doing the work of the devil by becoming a priest. I can not believe how stupid and evil this pastor is: [An LGBTQ Pastor’s Journey, David Norse](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=zWvLJNaVgrI).

> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
>
> —[Matthew 7:15, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207&version=KJV)

David Norse is a fake Christian, and I prove to you that God never supports the LGBTQIA+ people.

## Insulting Christian songs

If you watch just the first minute of the video, you should be able to tell right away that this man is not a Christian.

> […] and sing all of those really silly Christian songs and the serious ones that remind us about Jesus. I like the silly ones.

Notice how he insulted Christian songs.

Christian songs are made by people who want to express their faith in God through music. Was he making fun of those people?

Then this satanic guy continued saying that he learned the bible. I do not think he learned to find the truth. He learned to find justifications.

Let us rebuke his justifications.

> Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.
>
> —[1 Timothy 5:20, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Timothy%205%3A20&version=KJV)

## Bringing false teachings with the bible

First, he mentioned Leviticus, specifically [Leviticus 18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2018%3A22&version=KJV):

> Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.

How did he try to flip things upside-down? First, he highlighted the word "abomination" which he claimed to mean any actions that worship other god or idol. Then, he mentioned that the word relates to "temple prostitutes." Then, he said, "This was porn to Jewish people." Lastly, he jumped to another story. The end.

Great job! I thought this satanic guy tried something serious. I was ready to support LGBTQIA+. I almost ordered a rainbow flag. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris must be proud of him.

By the way, I am not a bible scholar. I do not understand the languages (Hebrew, Aramaic) and the culture—the same as him. I am just following along. But I can expose him with his own words and the knowledge I have.

Pay attention to what he just said: an act of prostitution was porn to Jewish people. What kind of prostitution is it? It is homosexuality. Does God forbid such action? God forbids humans from having same-sex intercourse. Otherwise, why does God say a man should not have sex with another man and a woman should not have sex with another woman? Can you see his stupidity?

If we read the verse, we know that this is not about worshiping an idol. How can "lie with mankind, as with womankind" become a worshiping idol? David Norse is stupid.

Now if we read together the whole chapter, we will know that God spoke to Moses. God tells him a list of abominations. What is the proof? [Leviticus 18:29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2018&version=KJV):

> For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their people.

This means one of the acts of abomination is having sex with the same gender. What was the punishment? Death.

Next, he talked about the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. Let me tell you something first. He kept saying stories as he wished and interpreting stories as he wished. He said that the story was about the horrors of sexual assault.

David Norse talked about context. But he talked out of context. There is nothing about the horrors of sexual assault. In fact, the story was about the wicked people in Sodom ([Genesis 13:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2013%3A13&version=KJV) and [Genesis 18:20](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2018%3A20&version=KJV)). God decided to destroy Sodom because the people were so wicked. Then, Abraham spoke with God. God said that even if there were ten righteous people, God would not destroy Sodom. In the end, God destroyed it since most of the people were very wicked.

Where are the "horrors of sexual assault"? David Norse, you wasted your time and learned nothing about the bible.

Then he mentioned hospitality. What the heck? Was he trying to say that God destroyed Sodom just because those men were forcing their way to Lot's house? David Norse, I highly suggest you study the bible again. Make sure your aim now is to find the truth and not to justify your sexual preference.

He continued by mentioning Paul. He praised Paul for unknown reasons. But Paul was against homosexuality. We could know that by reading [Romans 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%201&version=KJV). I highlight the following verse:

> And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.
>
> —Romans 1:27, King James Version

Paul would be the one who describes him as a wicked man.

Then, he mentioned Genesis. I thought, "This guy's stupidity has no limit." I could sense his lack of confidence in his voice. He was not even sure what he was talking about. But this would also be his end. He made a horrible mistake by mentioning Genesis.

He quoted [Genesis 2:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A18&version=KJV).

> And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.

Then he stopped. You should ask yourself: why did he stop? Why didn't he continue reading the rest of the chapter?

When God said that a man should not be alone, did God create another man? No. Instead, God created a woman ([Genesis 2:23](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%202%3A23&version=KJV)). What was the purpose of that? It was for the man and the woman to have children.

Can homosexual couples give birth to a child? No, they can not. Did God make sex for the sake of joy? No. God gives pleasure for sex so that humans want to reproduce. The purpose is not to satisfy one's sexual desire.

Being gay means a man finds sexual pleasure with another man. The same goes for a lesbian. Gays and lesbians aim for sexual satisfaction only. They ignore that God provides sexual organs so that humans can have children.

By the way, a man who acts like a woman is doing an abomination. The same goes for a woman who acts like a man. The following verse destroys all those gender liars (LGBTQIA+):

> If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
>
> —[Leviticus 20:13, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2020%3A13&version=KJV)

## Getting married

If you watch the video till the end, he announced that he would get married. Can you guess what he would do with the other guy after their marriage? They would play a sword game. I can tell you both the winner and the loser would not get anything.

## Following God's teaching only

Christians, we must be vigilant and smart. We should not allow people to fool us. We should not follow whatever a pastor, a priest, or even a pope says. Learn. Educate yourself.

I leave you with this verse.

> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.
>
> —Matthew 7:21, King James Version

I hope you learn something. Please tell me what you think.
