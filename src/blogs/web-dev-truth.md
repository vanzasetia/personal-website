In web development, we often do not have strict rules to decide right or wrong. Instead, we need to see a practice on a scale, such as from "lowest" to "highest."

"Best practices" refer to practices that are the best in most cases. Notice that not all best practices are the right practices. In fact, almost all of what people call "best practices" are neither right nor wrong. Some best practices can be bad practices in different contexts. Some bad practices can be good practices or even the best practices in different contexts.

For example, if you work in a team that uses [Block Element Modifier (BEM)](https://en.bem.info/) as a CSS methodology, using another one is a bad practice. In this case, the best practice is BEM. You make the codebase inconsistent when you use [CUBE CSS](https://cube.fyi/)â€”even though you think CUBE CSS is better than BEM. You should discuss first with your teammates and decide together whether changing the CSS methodology is good or bad for your team. Another example is that the [hamburger menu](/blog/one-action/) can be good or bad depending on the context.

But there are some right-or-wrong cases. Being a [Web Resigner](/blog/web-resign/) is totally wrong. Also, claiming to have [an accessible website for everyone](/people/actual-website/) is wrong. [No website is 100 percent accessible](/blog/inaccessible/) to all people. [Making unnecessary delay](/blog/useless-animation/) is wrong for whatever reasons.

In summary, almost everything depends on context and preference in the web development world. We should not evaluate things as all-or-nothing. We judge on a scale from "worst" to "best" based on context.
