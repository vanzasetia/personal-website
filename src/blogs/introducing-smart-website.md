I am happy to announce that I will publish my first-ever course: [Smart Website](/smart-website/). This upcoming course mainly aims for those who have a personal website and want to take it **beyond what they can imagine**. Not only that, this course is going to address popular misconceptions in web development. This means **everybody can benefit from this course** even without having a personal website.

Great web developers are aware of the huge potential of their personal websites. But many people do not realize those potentials. I am going to reveal those potentials to you in the Smart Website course.

This course does not dictate what you can do with your personal website. I am not saying that this course makes your website incredible easily. This course helps you to **personalize your website so that it reflects who you are**.

By the way, since this is new to me, you can give me feedback or suggestions. You can ask me questions. Please do feel free to have a chat with me. I want this course to be beneficial for you.

This course requires a lot of time and effort. But do not worry. **You do not need to pay to access the course**. You do not even need an email address—if you do not have one. As long as you have an internet connection, you can access the course.

You can share the course and tell your friends about this. You can also [donate](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/vanzasetia) if you want. Your support helps me to keep making great content for you.

I plan to make the course available in **August 2025**. I am working alone. But I try to finish it faster if possible.

In the meantime, I encourage you to [play with your website smartly](/smart-website/). Have fun.
