There are three billion Christians as people say. But how many of them follow **all** the teachings of Christ? The number will drastically shrink.

When I was in junior school, the school adopted Christ's teachings. But, most students can not speak without using the dirty words. They use filthy language to talk with their friends. Sadly, I was one of them. I was not Christian. I was a fool.

Church is the best place to find Christians. But are they **all** Christians? Do they go to the church to worship God together? Are they feeling obligated to come to a church? Are they praying to God asking to satisfy their worldly needs?

The priests are Christians, maybe. Do they serve themselves? Are they available when poor strangers need their services? Do they only serve the rich people?

The priests should fight against all anti-Christ teachings. Do they teach their people to accept any teaching against the Gospel? Do they bless homosexual couples? Do they love anti-Christ teachings? Do they worship statues or pictures? Do they invite a person to teach their people to follow Satanic teachings?

Those who claim to be Christian but approve of same-sex marriages, abortion, transgender, and other sinful actions are not Christians. They are the devils. Maybe they have been deceived. Maybe they are ignorant. Only God knows their hearts.

The more questions I ask, the less Christians are there.

One last question, when I am alone, can I find a Christian?
