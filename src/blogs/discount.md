Discount is something that is not counted. Why bother to write something nobody counts?

The market tells buying discount products is equal to saving money. I never feel I save money when shopping. Shopping is an act of spending money. Where is the "saving" part?

I hate online shopping dis-services that says, "You save this amount of money." That is a lie because if I save that money, I can use it to buy more things. But no. This savings amount is a completely meaningless fake number. If the number is one million, I can not use that money.
