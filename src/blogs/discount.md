Discount is price that is not counted. Why bother to write something nobody counts?

The market tells buying discount products is equal to saving money. I do not feel like I am saving money when I shop. Shopping means spending money. Where is the "saving" part?

I hate online shopping dis-services that says, "You saved this amount of money." That is a lie because if I really saved that money, I could use it to buy more things. But no, that savings amount is a meaningless number. Even if it is a million, I can not use it.

Do not get fooled by the discount tactic.
