[Light Thoughts](https://social.linux.pizza/@299792458ms/113872673708362073) nominated me for a challenge. How dare you challenge me? I accept your challenge. Bring it on!

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I wanted to share my knowledge with people. I did not want the knowledge that I got only for myself. I wanted people who had the same problems as me could solve their problems. For example, I wrote a guide to help people develop websites on their Android devices because I did not have a computer back then. Before I got the idea to write that, I had a strong feeling to make websites. I really wanted to make websites. I wanted to get started as soon as possible. Since I only had an Android device, I learned web development with that device. Once I got used to making websites for about six months, I started writing about the way I made websites with an Android device. I wrote about it because I was sure there were people like me who did not have a laptop or a computer but had a passion for programming or web development.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Yes. I was writing my articles on CodeNewbie, and I got thousands of views.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog, and why did you choose it?

I use [VS Codium](https://vscodium.com/), which is a free/libre software version of VS Code, without any proprietary code from Microsoft.

## How do you write your posts?

I have a `_draft` folder in my working directory. Every time I get new idea, I immediately write it down on a text file.

Then, I leave it and come back to it with fresh perspective to decide whether I will publish it. If I do not publish it, I delete it. If I publish it, I continue writing or rewriting it until it is finished.

After that, I fix all grammar errors with [Grammarly](https://grammarly.com/) and simplify the article with [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/). (I am not sponsored by Grammarly and Hemingway.)

After everything is okay, I publish it.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

When a brilliant idea pops into my head, that moment makes me really excited to write about it. But I wish the idea would appear in daytime. It usually happens when I am lying on my bed at night, ready to sleep.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

I already answered it. I do not publish immediately.

## Whatâ€™s your favorite post on your blog?

This is a hard question. I like all my articles. They are all in high-quality and have strong voices. They are educative too. Some are even funny.

I think my favorite article is [The Beginner Guide to Develop Websites on Android](/blog/guide-develop-websites-android/). This article has been rewritten many, many times. It was first published at [CodeNewbie](https://web.archive.org/web/20220703003113/https://community.codenewbie.org/vanzasetia/the-ultimate-guide-to-code-on-android-its-possible-5flo) on 13 January 2022. It was the best article that I had written on the platform. I was happy that it got thousands of views.

I remember when I wrote that article on my low-end Android device. I still could feel the struggle that I was experiencing. The lag was really annoying.

That article truly shows my progress as a writer.

## Any future plans for your blog?

They are secret. I want to surprise my readers. Be ready!

## Who will participate next?

I believe lots of people will participate. This is an incredible challenge. It is like a web ring, connecting one website to another.

I checked people that I know, and they already did the challenge. If you want to be nominated, email me.

I am happy to know that the questions are not about math. Otherwise, I will regret accepting the challenge.

Thank you, Light Thoughts, for telling me about this challenge.
