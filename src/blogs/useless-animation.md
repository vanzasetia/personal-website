I must wait seven seconds before I can log in to a website because I need to see an animation. I hate that.

The animation creates unnecessary delay and offers no practical benefits. Every time I visit the website, I have to see a jumping square for five seconds. Then, I have to wait for a heading to appear. After that, a paragraph appears underneath it. Next, a login button fades in and becomes visible under the paragraph. Only after all that boring show, I can finally click that button.

At first, I can bear with the animation. After a while, I become impatient. I scream in my heart, "Why do I need to wait? What is the thought process behind this?"

If the webmaster thinks a jumping square is needed to tell the users that the website is still loading, the webmaster does not realize that a browser already has a loading indicator. The webmaster does not need to create one.

The lesson here is never to animate essential elements. If the users can access the information immediately, why do you make them wait?

## Notes

In the past, I could log in to the website right away. No nonsense at all.

To remove the animation, I contacted the webmaster two weeks ago through WhatsApp—a proprietary software—but have not yet received a reply. I have also contacted the webmaster by email but have not received a reply.

The contact info is inside a hamburger menu. If you are on a mobile device, the contact info is hidden. This is a poor design decision as if the webmaster does not want to be contacted.

If you want to know the website, contact me through email.
