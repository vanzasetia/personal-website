I must wait seven seconds before I can log in to a website because I need to see lots of animations. I hate those.

The animation creates unnecessary delay and offers no practical benefits. Every time I visit the website, I have to see a loading screen which is a jumping white square on a purple background. The loading screen takes five seconds to disappear. Then, I have to wait for a heading to appear. After that, a paragraph appears underneath it. Next, a login button fades in and becomes visible under the paragraph. Only after all that boring show, I can finally click that button.

At first, I can bear with the animation. After a while, I become impatient. I scream in my heart, "Why do I need to wait? What is the thought process behind this?"

Why don't just show everything at once? Remove the loading screen. Show the page immediately. No need to have those fade-in animations.

If the webmaster thinks a jumping square is needed to tell the users that the website is still loading, the webmaster does not realize that a browser already has a loading indicator. Every browser has it. It works well. No extra code is needed. The webmaster does not need to create one.

I learned two lessons: never make a loading screen and never animate essential elements. If the users can access the information immediately, why do you make them wait?

## Notes

In the past, I could log in to the website right away. No nonsense at all.

To remove the animation, I contacted the webmaster two weeks ago through WhatsApp—a proprietary software—but have not yet received a reply. I have also contacted the webmaster by email but have not received a reply.

The contact info is inside a hamburger menu. If you are on a mobile device, the contact info is hidden. This is a poor design decision as if the webmaster does not want to be contacted.

If you want to know the website, contact me through email.
