You do not need to learn everything. This goes for everything in life.

To speak English, you do not need to learn everything about English. If the other person can understand what you say, that is enough.

You do not need to be good at grammar. People will forgive you. They might not even care about it. For example, if you say, "Yesterday, I meet with my friends at school." That does not mean the other person will criticize you and highlight your grammar mistakes, especially when the person knows that you are not a native speaker. If the person fails to understand, the person will ask again about what you just said. The person most likely does not want you to feel uncomfortable or make the conversation awkward.

By the way, I do not think that native English people are good at grammar. If you are a native English person, do you care about the grammar rules of your language? In an informal context, grammar is often overlooked and is ignored intentionally to make the conversation more comfortable. So do not worry too much about grammar.

I do not learn everything about English to write lots of great articles. I do not need to do that. The same goes for you. Start writing now instead of waiting until you become an English expert.

I understand that **I learn something because I need it**. Otherwise, there is no point in learning about it. I encourage you to do the same. If you think you need to learn something, learn about it. If you do not want it or do not need it, do not learn about it. **Do not make learning complicated**.

The same goes for programming. I do not need to learn Java because I do not need it. I do not want it. I do not need to learn about complex algorithms. I do not need them to achieve what I want.

Remember, you are not alone on this planet. Every person helps each other. For example, I still need other people to make clothes. I can not sew clothes by myself. I need clothes, but that does not mean I need to learn to sew clothes.

To sum up, you do not need to learn everything because you are not alone, and you can not learn everything even in just one subject. That is normal because **we are humans**.

You do not need to learn everything. Just learn what you **really** need to achieve your goals.
