If you do not want [to be unburdened by what has been done by Joe Biden and Kamala Harris](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=j6qzYdGwQBY), vote for Donald Trump.

I am not saying that you, the American people, should vote for Trump because he is chosen by God. That is silly. You vote for Donald Trump because he did a great job in the past.

Now, food prices are going up. They are expensive. War is happening. Biden and Harris do not have any intention to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine. The border is not secure. [Kamala Harris has said herself that prices are going up](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=BEd_LhA_FW0) when she is in charge. She fails.

Kamala Harris becomes black on election days. She can change colors like a chameleon. But the truth is that she is not black. She is an Indian. Anyway, she can be whatever she wants at election time.

What does skin color have anything to do with being a president? I do not understand that. I do not care about the skin color of the American president. I care about the results.

I read books about hatred toward Donald Trump such as "The Cult of Trump," "Assholes: A Theory of Donald Trump," and "Trumpocalypse." None of the authors complain about high gas prices or expensive food. They are busy judging the personality of Trump.

People become popular authors once they mock Trump. They make money out of Trump.

I care about the United States presidential election even though I am not a United States citizen. The result of it will affect most countries in the world.

If you vote for Kamala Harris, that means you vote for a person who has proven herself to be a failure.

Also, if you vote for Kamala Harris, block this website. Put the address of my website in your blocklist. I do not want you to be my visitor. You choose a person who focuses on gender rather than fixing the country's economy. Go away.

Vote for Trump. If I lived in America, I would vote for Trump. Vote for Trump for low food prices.
