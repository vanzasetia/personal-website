Atheists are not smart when they talk about their beliefs because they do not believe in anything anyway. They do not have a book. They believe they are animals. Again, they are animals. But they

- feel guilty when they kill a wrong person; and
- do not want to have sex with their siblings; and
- feel sad when they watch people being tortured; and
- want to only have one spouse and be loyal to their spouse—but only a few of them.

Why do animals feel guilty when they kill the wrong person? Actually, there is no right or wrong for animals. Why do atheists not want to have sex with their siblings? I never heard animals reject having sex with their own family members. Why do atheist people feel sad when they watch people dying? I never saw a cat feel sad when another cat gets eaten by another cat. Why do some atheist people only want to have one spouse? I never knew an animal that stayed together after having sex. A female cat is alone after having sex with a male cat. The female cat does not feel betrayed. But humans can feel betrayed.

Atheist people expose themselves when they try to destroy Christianity. They are stupid. They are animals, so being stupid is normal. We can not expect human intelligence from animals.

But I do not hate atheist people. I do not hate them. As long as they do not insult Christ, I do not hate them. They can insult me, and I will learn to forgive them. But I will confront them if they insult my Lord, Jesus Christ.

I feel sad because they live in confusion. *Actually*, I do not feel sad at all. They choose to live in that way. They can do whatever they want.

When they fight against wicked people, I will join them. I will join them to destroy the wicked people.

As a Christian, I do not take a side. I only take a side with the truth. Thus, when atheist people support kindness and love, I support them.
