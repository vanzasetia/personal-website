Some people have access to clean water and can use shampoo and soap but can not wash their bodies by themselves. They are people with stroke or paralyzed people.

Some people can wash their bodies themselves but do not have access to clean water. They are people who live in extreme poverty.

I lived in a village once because I joined a school retreat when I was in junior high school. The "bathroom" was near a small and simple cowshed. It did not even have a door.

Before I continue the story, I quote the word bathroom because it does not have a bathtub. If you are a Western, you may not be aware that Indonesian bathrooms are different from your typical bathrooms. You can search with a search engine about Indonesian bathrooms, especially in the village.

Going back to my story, to enter the "bathroom," I needed to take a U-turn. This means I could still hide myself, although it did not have a door. But I still needed to make sure that nobody was inside when I came in, and nobody would come when I was inside.

To get water, I must draw water from a well near the "bathroom." But I only did that once. Whenever I wanted to wash myself, my temporary parents there were kind enough to make sure there was water.

Then, when I was washing my body at one night, I heard a cow mooing. I felt that the cow was watching me naked. It might try to say something about my body. Hahaha.

Then, there was no toilet. The toilet was in a different place and was a squat toilet. The room was small. As far as I remember, the room did not have a lamp. The toilet's color was gray. It was made of cement. It did not have ceramic. It was pure cement without decoration. It might have a doorâ€”I am not sure, but **it should have a door**.

That was a great and bad experience at the same time. It was great because I realized how blessed I am that my home has a much better bathroom, although it does not have a bathtub. But it was bad because I did not poop while I was there for three days and two nights.

So, if you can wash your body yourself with nice lighting, have access to clean water, can use shampoo and soap, can use a bathroom with a door, be grateful and happy.
