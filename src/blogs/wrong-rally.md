Someone shouts,

> Jesus is Lord!

Then, Kamala Harris replied,

> Oh, you guys are at the wrong rally.

I agree with Kamala. Christians should not be in Kamala Harris' rally. They should not support a person who wants to [kill babies](https://www.christianpost.com/news/kamala-harris-says-no-to-religious-exemptions-for-abortion.html).

I hope America's election becomes a good example for those who mock Jesus. This election also shows that when Christians take action, they can win against the anti-Christ.

Let us also hope that America will be better once President-elect Donald Trump is in the office.
