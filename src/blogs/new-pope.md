Christian Catholic people have just gotten a new pope. His name is Pope Leo XIV, also known as Robert Francis Prevost. He is from the United States of America (USA).

I hope this new pope shares the truth and [follows only the Bible](/blog/christians-around/). I pray that the new pope will fix everything that [Pope Francis had done](/blog/pope-francis/).

I watched [his speech](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=-0l6HaSMqtI), but I still can not say anything about him.

I *really* hope he will produce good fruit.
