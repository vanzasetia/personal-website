You should be happy when you

- can eat; and
- have something to eat; and
- have appetite.

Do you think those three blessings are guaranteed?

- There are people who can eat and have an appetite but do not have anything to eat. They are poor people.
- There are people who have something to eat but may not have an appetite and can not eat. They are sick people.
- There are people who can not eat, do not have anything to eat, and do not have an appetite. They are poor people and have an illness.

So if you can eat, have something to eat, and have an appetite, you must be grateful because **remember** those blessings are not guaranteed for you forever. God can take those blessings anytime and anywhere.

Be happy. Be grateful. Knowing that you can eat today.
