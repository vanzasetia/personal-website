In a forest, a donkey talked with a tiger and said, "The grass is blue."

The tiger disagreed with the donkey and replied, "The grass is green, donkey."

But the donkey insisted that the grass was blue. So they went and asked the king of the forest, a lion.

The tiger asked, "What is the color of grass? Green or blue?"

The lion smiled and said, "The grass is blue."

The donkey shouted, "See? I am right! The grass is blue."

Then the donkey left both the tiger and the lion.

The tiger got confused and asked, "Why do you say the grass is blue? Don't you know that grass is green?"

The lion replied, "Yes I know that, and you know that as well. So why do you argue about it anyway?"

## Message

If someone tries to troll you, no matter who the person is, ignore that person. The more you respond, the more power that person has over you. Do not let your anger control you. Responding to a donkey is a foolish action.

Be kind, but do not be a fool.
