If a website asks me to turn off my ad-blocker, I do not turn it off. In fact, I use [uBlock Origin](https://gothub.projectsegfau.lt/gorhill/uBlock), which is more than an ad-blocker, and it always turns on.

I do not mind seeing advertisements when they do not track me. Even better, if the ads use [free/libre JavaScript](https://www.fsf.org/campaigns/freejs), I would not feel bad at all. I can always ignore ads, but I can not ignore them when they are tracking me.

A website that asks me to give up my privacy is egregious. I would not give up my privacy, so the website's owner can get moneyâ€”usually very little. My privacy is more important than that.

I hope you do the same.
