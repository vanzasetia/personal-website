I do not hate homosexual people. Because I care about them, I tell them what they are doing is wrong. If I justify what they say—as stupid people do by using the term "homophobia"—I legitimize their wrongdoing. I care about homosexual people, especially [those who claim to be Christians](/blog/gay-pastor/). I need to tell them directly and clearly: **being a homosexual person means you are not a Christian.**

When I was a kid, my mother got angry when she knew I played soccer in the rain. She shouted at me. Her anger did not mean that she hated me. She did not want me to get sick. She loved me. She wanted me to stay healthy. I do not hold grudge against her. In fact, every time I remember that I feel happy that I have a loving mother.

Only stupid people say that Christians should be soft. In fact, Christians are warriors. We are Crusaders. We fight against the devil. We can not be soft with the devil. If we compromise, we will lose against the devil. This is why a Christian can not be a homosexual or a transgender person.

Christians are sinners. But Christians do not legitimize an act of sin. Sins are sins. The problem occurs when a Christian starts saying that a sin is okay to do. For example, [Pope Francis](/blog/pope-francis/) once allowed blessings for homosexual couples. Pope Francis legitimized a sin. We can not tolerate such a thing. Blessing is an act of support or agreement. Any Christians must never bless homosexuality. Never.

Christians love our enemies. Stupid people say that Christians love to get hurt. We are not stupid. But our love follows the love of God. God teaches humans to be humans. God demands Christians to sacrifice for others as an example. But not all kinds of human suffering are for God. For example, if a man gets a sexual disease because he had sex with so many women, his suffering is not for God. He suffers because of his lust. But if a Christian man gets mocked when he preaches the Gospel, his suffering is good for God. He wants to save people, although the people mock him.

Although through my writings I am harsh with those [crazy people](/blog/crazy/), I hope they repent. If they do not, at least after they read my articles, they know they have been warned.

Jesus taught his disciples the following:

> ^12^ And when ye come into an house, salute it.
>
> ^13^ And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
>
> ^14^ And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.
>
> ^15^ Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.
>
> —[Matthew 10:12-15, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew%2010%3A12-15&version=KJV)

Not everyone will welcome Christians. We will not beg to those who do not receive the teachings of Christ. We leave them. They choose to reject the wisdom of God. Nothing we can do then.

In summary, Christians warn everybody. But if people do not repent, we have done our job. We love them. If they reject our love, that is their business.
