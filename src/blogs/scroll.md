**TL;DR:** Remove "scroll down" text from your website. Do not ask your users to scroll down.

When your users arrive at your website, they will always start from the top of your website. They also know that if they want to see more information from your website, they will explore it and know how to do that.

Besides, how do you know that all your users will scroll? If some of them use a touchscreen device, you are giving the wrong instruction. You do not know whether they will scroll or swipe or press the [[Tab]] key or press the [[Space]] key or any other ways when they are exploring your website.

If you think putting a down arrow or any icon on your website is genius work, you are not doing anything smart. The icon makes asking the users to explore your website more inclusive. You also prevent yourself from using the word "scroll" or "swipe" or other specific words to navigate the website. But your users know what to do. They are not new people. Even if they are, they will figure out what to do.

By default, elements on the website start from the top to the bottom. If your website flow is like that, you do not need to tell your users to go to the bottom of your page. They will do that if they want to.
