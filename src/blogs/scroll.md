Remove "scroll down" text from your website. Do not ask your users to scroll down.

When you arrive at this website, you start from the top. You know that to see more information on a webpage, you scroll down. Your users are the same. They scroll down when they want to explore your website.

But, how do you know that all your users will scroll? You do not know whether they will scroll or swipe or press the [[Tab]] key or press the [[Space]] key or any other ways to explore your website.

If you think putting a down arrow or any icon on your website is genius work, you are not doing anything smart. I agree that the icon makes asking the users to explore your website more inclusive. You prevent yourself from using the word "scroll" or "swipe" or other specific words to navigate the website. But your users know what to do. They are not new people. Even if they are, they will figure out what to do.

By default, elements on the website start from the top to the bottom. If your website flow is like that, you do not need to tell your users to go to the bottom of your page. They will do that if they want to.
