I watched the following video: [Trump argues with Zelenskyy in Oval Office](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=Q9gy9wr7Ucw). Then, I said to myself, "Trump and JD Vance were showing their superiority to Zelenskyy." That is what the whole video is all about.

Both of Trump and JD were being disrespectful to Zelenskyy. They told Zelenskyy what to do and not to do. Yet they said Zelenskyy was the one who was disrespectful to them.

A week ago, Trump said Zelenskyy is "a modestly successful comedian." Who is actually being disrespectful?

In fact, Trump was—and is—[the comedian](/blog/trump-jokes/).

Back to the video, after Zelenskyy explained the Ukrainian people had been betrayed many times, he asked

> What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean?

Then, JD Vance got angry and argued that the US would stop the destruction. He asked Zelenskyy to be thankful.

JD, I tell you that you have not stopped the war, but you wanted Zelenskyy to say "thank you." What is the logic behind this?

Next, while Zelenskyy was saying something about JD speaking loudly, Trump cut him off by saying, "He is not speaking loudly." You were the loudest one, Trump. Zelenskyy's voice was the lowest one.

Zelenskyy wants to stop the war. But he is not so stupid. He asks for guarantees. But Trump and JD do not give him any information.

"What if Russia breaks ceasefire?" asked a reporter. The answer is nothing. The United States (US) will do nothing—none of the US presidents has cared about Ukraine since 2014.

The actual answer is very stupid. Trump asked back, "What if a bomb drops on your head right now?" That is a very funny and very silly answer. I laughed a lot. Trump is a comedian. He has a talent.

Back in 1994, Ukraine gave up its nuclear in exchange for the United States, United Kingdom, and Russia [guaranteeing Ukraine's security](https://www.npr.org/2022/02/21/1082124528/ukraine-russia-putin-invasion). When Russia attacked Ukraine in 2014, did the US help Ukraine? No, the US did nothing. So why would the US help Ukraine now if Putin breaks another ceasefire agreement?

I hope Zelenskyy does not sign any agreements or deals until he knows exactly what they are and makes sure that they do not include the 50 percent ownership of rare minerals. Even better, he should not trust America ever again.
