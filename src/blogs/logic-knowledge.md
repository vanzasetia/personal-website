We have a brain. Our brain loves to draw conclusions based on what we read, listen to, or see. Without having a conclusion, we can not make a decision. Our conclusion often has our judgment. But if you draw a conclusion using purely logical theory, you will make stupid conclusions.

All logicians will agree that if the first and the second premises are true, the conclusion can be right or wrong. How do they decide that? They decide based on the knowledge they have. The problem is that the prior knowledge can be right or wrong. Wrong knowledge will lead to a false judgment of the conclusion, and the same goes for the opposite.

For example:

1. All humans are mortal.
1. Golan is a human.
1. In conclusion, Golan is mortal.

I believe we all agree with the above conclusion. But how about the following example?

1. All atheists support LGBTQIA+.
1. Joe Biden supports LGBTQIA+.
1. Thus, Joe Biden is an atheist.

If you think that the conclusion is false because Joe Biden claims to be a believer, you are wrong. You have a lack of knowledge of Christianity.

Although Joe Biden claims that he is a Christian Catholic, he does not act like a Christian. In fact, his actions show that he is an atheist. He does not believe in God. He does not do the will of God by defending the stupid LGBTQIA+ movement. If he is a Christian, he should never [celebrate Easter and proclaim Transgender Day of Visibility at the same time](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/churches-lgbtq-groups-celebrate-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday-drag-me-to-church) when he was the president.

Remember, a Christian can not be both supporting evil and good at the same time. If a Christian does not fight against the devil, this person is not a Christian, although this person does not do anything to support the devil. Doing nothing is the same as supporting the devil. By being silent, the devil will take over easily. The only way to win against the devil is to fight the devil.

In summary, the prior knowledge and the context play an important role in judging whether a conclusion is right or wrong. Without the right knowledge, you will make foolish judgments. This is why logic without knowledge results in a false conclusion. Also, logic with false knowledge results in foolish judgment. In short, logic is not enough to make the right judgments.
