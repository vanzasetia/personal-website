I saw a video with the following title: [President Trump Signs No Men in Women's Sports Executive Order Into Law](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=_f3Nhvz_o5A).

Then, I asked myself, "Why does America need a law to prevent men in women's sports?"

If we use our common sense, isn't that obvious that men should not be allowed in women's sports? This is the same as men who are not allowed to get into the women's bathrooms.

Some humans are foolish. They can not even tell their gender. They get confused. They ask stupid questions like, "Am I a male?" or "Am I a female?" What's wrong with them? Even monkeys know their gender. Yet some humans have no idea about their gender!?

I feel sorry for those women who lost because of those menâ€”or fake women.

There is a [study (PDF, 446KB)](https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n24/249/94/pdf/n2424994.pdf) conducted by the United Nations (UN) says the following:

> The replacement of the female sports category with a mixed-sex category has resulted in an increasing number of female athletes losing opportunities, including medals, when competing against males. According to information received, by 30 March 2024, over ==600 female athletes in more than 400 competitions have lost more than 890 medals in 29 different sports.==

"Over 600 female athletes," those women lose because of unfairness.

This is really weird. I do not know what to say.

What are the purpose of having sport competitions for women only in the first place? Professional athletes should know the answer to that questions. So how come then men are allowed to compete with women in such event? I feel like people have lost their common sense.

Humans have two genders only: male and female. That's it. Do not add a new gender.

Trump is making America sane again. That is good. But that is also showing that America is not sane now.

Tell me what you think.
