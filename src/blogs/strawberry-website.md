Strawberry website is only beautiful on specific screen sizes. When the user has a different screen size or resizes the browser window, the website has problems. It is not fully responsive.

Strawberry website contains amazing graphics. But it is slow to load.

Strawberry website depends on JavaScript too much. It has incredible functionality. But, when the JavaScript fails to load, it can not show anything. It becomes a blank page.

Strawberry website requires a lot of things. It may require a specific screen size. For instance, if the user's screen size is not wide enough, the website will give the user a notice. It can also be about the browser. For example, the website requires the users to use Chromium-based browsers to function properly. If the users use Firefox, they will get a notice to use a Chromium-based browser to access the website. In short, the website has a lot of demands.
