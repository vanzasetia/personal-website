"Strawberry Website" is a term to refer to a fragile website. What are the characteristics?

- Strawberry Website is only beautiful on specific screen sizes. When a user has a different screen size or resizes the browser window, the website has layout issues. It is not fully responsive.
- Strawberry Website has wonderful images, but it is slow to load.
- Strawberry Website depends on JavaScript too much. It has incredible functionality. But, when the JavaScript fails to load, it becomes a blank page.
- Strawberry Website has many requirements to work well. It may need a specific screen size. If the user's screen size is not wide enough, the website will give the user a notice. So if you use a mobile device, the website will say, "Your screen is not wide enough. Use desktop instead." It can also be about the browser. For example, the website requires the users to use Chromium-based browsers to function. If the users use Firefox, they will get a notice to use a Chromium-based browser. In short, the website has a lot of demands.
