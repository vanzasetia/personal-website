If something works, it is fine. This is a fallacy. Just because something works does not mean it is fine.

In web development, [using CSS ID selectors](/blog/basic-guide-css-selector/) (`#`) will not break a stylesheet. The styles still apply. The stylesheet works, but it is not fine due to [high specificity](/blog/dangerous-css/).

The statement "if something works, it is fine" is a logical fallacy. You might think that if a man smiles, he is happy. But that is false because he might hide his true feelings. In programming, just because your code works does not mean it is correct. Valid syntax does not mean valid logic. Thus, this logical fallacy makes poor judgment.

Another version of this fallacy is "if something works, it is right." This is also false. Just because something works does not mean it is right. For instance, violating user privacy without their knowledge helps Facebook succeed, but it is not the right thing to do. It is not ethical. If you judge something as right just because it works, you oversimplify and overestimate its value.

Do not be fooled by oversimplified wisdom.
