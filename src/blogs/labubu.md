I heard from someone recently that people are crazy over Labubu dolls because of Lisa. They make those dolls become popular and as a result, the dolls become [very expensive](https://www.popmart.com/us/search/LABUBU).

First, I do not know anything about Lisa. I do not care about her. I am not into K-pop stuff. I did not even know anything about Labubu dolls if nobody told me.

People who buy Labubu dolls because of Lisa, a member of Blackpink, are stupid.

I do not know how they decide to buy those ugly dolls just because of one person. If you search "Labubu dolls" on the Internet, you will see monsters. Their smiles are creepy.

I admit that Lisa is famous. But I do not understand her fans who buy everything she wears or uses. They are so stupid.

I researched a bit. Then, I found a video of [Lisa reviewing Labubu dolls](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=L8bUVgl3Ors). After Lisa got neither the yellow nor gray doll, she said the following:

> This is why you have to get the whole box.

What the heck? Are people buying them because of Lisa? Unbelievable.

By the way, I believe Lisa did not buy any of those dolls in the video.

The video has 15 million views now. I write educative articles, and I do not even get ten thousand views in total. I do not put analytics. But I can guess the number of my viewers based on the bandwidth usage.

Again, I found a video on TikTok—I do not have a TikTok account by the way—showing a bunch of fools [waiting in front of Pop Mart at 02:30 AM](https://www.tiktok.com/@yunovaa/video/7428197441645628690)—warning, the link goes to TikTok. If you do not want TikTok to track you, watch [the video with offTikTok](https://www.offtiktok.com/post/1391).

If you watch that video till the end, you should see hundreds of people were spending money to get those dolls. Even the one who made the video said, "In total, we waited about 11 hours […]." That person wasted 11 hours just to get garbage.

Also, I found some headlines about people getting scammed. I feel sorry for those people. They spent lots of money. Yet, they got fake dolls only.

Actually, I do not feel sorry. That shows people are so desperate to the point they become so stupid. They are so hopeless.

This phenomenon—buying garbage—happens because those people have nothing else better to do. They worship a person. They waste their money to buy such dolls. They should ask themselves a simple question: What will they do with those dolls in the next 10 years? Those dolls do not [matter](/blog/matter/) in the end. They will become garbage.

Folks, do not be one of those people. Use your time and money wisely.
