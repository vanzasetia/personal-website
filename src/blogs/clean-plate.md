If you eat, do you make sure that your plate is clean? "Clean plate" here does not mean washing the dish. It means not leaving food on your plate after you are done eating.

I do not know how the western people eat usually. But in places where rice is the main food on the plate, most people tend to leave some rice on their plates.

Once I saw a person ordering fried rice. Then the person only ate half of it and left the place. I thought, "That person did not know hunger and did not respect the food." Later, the one who sold the fried rice took the plate and threw the rest of it into a trash bin. This was a bad sight for me.

You can imagine you see [a plate with some food on it](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Lmxckg4xVs2tOVQVlRvMOQHaFc%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=6a97ed5e089c3b54d31a758d76677df4acd275e483b121a00c6a137ff283e491&ipo=images). Then someone throws all of it away. What do you think?

If you put yourself as the one who cooks the food and your customer only eats a bit of it and leaves your restaurant, how would you feel? If you have empathy and are a good person, you will feel uncomfortable. I will feel annoyed if I am in that position.

In 99.99% of cases, I eat everything on my plate. As long as I can use my hands to eat, I will not leave a single bite of food on my plate. I am aware that many people can not even get anything to eat to this day. To show that I am grateful, I finish my food.

Do not be stupid by believing that leaving food on your plates means you are rich. For those who believe in that, you are an idiot. That shows how foolish you are! Being rich has nothing to do with leaving food on a plate. Do not be silly.

Make sure your [gratitude](/blog/eat/) is not just by mouth or by writing. Show it by eating the whole food. Make it a habit. If you already have the habit, keep it going for the rest of your life.
