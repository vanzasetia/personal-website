Are you on a mobile device? I apologize for the title. It is discriminating you, isn't it? But, do you know that you can connect a mouse to your spy phone also, unpopularly known as a smart-at-spying-on-you device? Do you even aware that you are tapping instead of clicking?

I also apologize to keyboard users. You can not click anything. You can not even hear the "click" sound.

I can not apologize to all types of users. So no more apologize.

Now, I have a message: stop asking your users to "click here." They know what to do. They know where to click as well. Replace those "click" words with the **actual** action such as "buy," "view," "read," and "download."

Some web developers may say, "What if we do both?"

"What do you mean by that?" I reply.

"We ask our users to **click to read this article**. For example, 'click here to read this article.'"

That is redundant. Also, your users are not that stupid to the point you need to tell every detail about the link. They may not even care about your article. **Just tell them the purpose of the link**.

Another option is to tell them the title of the article. Here is a wonderful and smart example: [Click Here](./).

The end.
