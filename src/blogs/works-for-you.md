In doing your work, you should start figuring out what works for you first. This is the best strategy when you start doing something new. Begin with the most natural task. For example, if you start writing a blog post, start doing the most natural task for you. This may mean you do a task that does not need lots of energy like jotting down your thoughts without judgments. You can also do something easy like making a voice note.

In my case, the most natural task will be free writing. I will write a title first. Next, I write whatever I want with any language I am comfortable with. Then, I will manually revise my draft without any tools. After I am happy with my draft, I start using [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/) to refine my draft. Then, I re-read that as much as I need. After everything is good, I share the blog post with people on the internet.

My approach is not the best in the world. But it is the best for me. It works for me. This is the most important fact.

I urge you to do the same. Find what works for you. Then, finishing your work will come naturally, and you will enjoy the process. Also, you will feel a sense of uniqueness which is a very nice feeling.

As a side note, I am not sponsored by Grammarly and Hemingway.
