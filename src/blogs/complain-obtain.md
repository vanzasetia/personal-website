In the boarding house, I am the one who often complains. The water is off. The light in the bathroom—without a bathtub or even a shower—is broken. The bathroom is dirty. When one of those things happens, I complain immediately.

::: note Indonesian's bathrooms
Most Indonesian bathrooms do not have a bathtub or a shower. The bathrooms I use have a large plastic bucket to store the water and a plastic water ladle to pour the water on my body.

For Indonesian people, a bathroom with a bathtub and a shower is luxurious. Only expensive hotels and rich people have them.

But I am not alone in my boarding house. There are two other people. But they never complain.

You may think that they do not complain because I already complain. But that is not true.

At one moment, I did not complain about a broken light in a bathroom. I wanted to see whether someone else would complain about it. After two days, I was the one who complained. Then, the broken light was replaced the next day.

I do not understand. We used that bathroom daily. But those two were okay taking a bath in the darkness.

Again, I do not understand. Why don't those people complain? They already pay. They deserve to have good facilities. If something is not right, they can easily contact the owner of the boarding house through text message or phone call. In fact, their parents know the family of the owner's boarding house. That makes it easier for them to complain—unlike me, who is a stranger.

I learned that I must talk to get what I want. Otherwise, people will not know. Even worse, they may pretend to be ignorant thinking that I am okay with whatever conditions.

Anyway, what do you think?
