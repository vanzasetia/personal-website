## What is Web Resign?

Web Resign is a new concept practiced by thousands of web developers by removing or ignoring standard web practices and functionalities. For example, web developers [make a list with the paragraph elements and the HTML br elements](https://www.htmhell.dev/30-bullet-list/)—ignoring the native list elements. Another example is to [make a loading screen](/blog/useless-animation/) to show that the page is still loading. They ignore that every browser has a loading indicator—that requires zero lines of code.

Those actions are not extreme compared to resigning all borders, except the bottom one, to design input elements. HTML input elements have turned into ["onput" elements](https://briefs.video/videos/what-happened-to-text-inputs/).

## Who are Web Resigners?

Web Resigners, web developers who do Web Resign, fire many semantic HTML elements because they do not have the same standard as Web Content Resignation Guideline (WCRG).

:::note Grammar checkers on "Web Resigner"
I do not why grammar checkers keep fixing "Web Resigner" to "Web Designer." Maybe, they hate Web Resigners.

Web Resigners do not use an anchor tag to make a link that looks like a button. They do not use CSS. They use [a button element instead](https://www.htmhell.dev/34-a-button-is-not-a-link/). If that is too normal, they use [an HTML form element with a button element](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2906582/how-do-i-create-an-html-button-that-acts-like-a-link#answer-31192621). The button element has the `formaction` attribute. Otherwise, the form element has the `action` attribute to make sure when a user clicks the button, the user gets navigated to another place—or page.

Some Web Resigners agree to use the anchor tags to make links on their articles, but without the underline. They believe that underlined links are too conventional. So the underline is assigned to a more crucial mission. The mission is to tell readers that the underlined text is important because it is not a link.

Web Resigners ask important questions before using semantic HTML elements. For example, a Web Resigner asks, "How do I make an HTML div element clickable?" The Web Resigner does not consider using a button element or a link element or any other standard HTML elements. Another question is, "How do I make an image element without using an HTML image element?"

Why does a Web Resigner ask such questions? A Web Resigner—with 10++ years of disgraceful experience—knows the answer.

## Why are Web Resigners better than Web Designers?

Web Designers, people who design and develop great websites, make the web too normal and too accessible. The web will not become challenging anymore.

But Web Resigners ensure that a website is fun. People can have an accessibility overlay to make the particular website look the way they want. In fact, people do not have the time and willingness to customize each website they visit. Also, the accessibility overlay itself is often not accessible. But, that is the purpose of Web Resigners: to make a web as a game to test your skill and your patience—not just putting lots of intrusive ads or automatically playing 10 videos to waste users' cellular data.

## How do Web Resigners handle the legal requirements?

Are Web Resigners afraid of getting punished because of making fun (of) websites? Don't worry. Just use an accessibility overlay. No matter how many issues they make, an accessibility overlay will solve all problems. Yes, all the problems are magically gone. Can you believe it?

By the way, Web Resigners ignore [Overlay Fact Sheet](https://overlayfactsheet.com/) and [Overlay False Claims](https://overlayfalseclaims.com/).

Does an accessibility overlay create new accessibility problems? Again, don't worry. Just add another accessibility overlay on top of the existing accessibility overlay. Is an accessibility overlay on an accessibility overlay problematic? Stop thinking about it. Then, the problems will disappear from your mind.

## Is there any hope left?

I hope 20XX will be a better year when Web Resign is more popular than Web Design. People will start hiring a Web Resigner instead of a Web Designer.

## Is there a song?

> Heal the web, make it a better place…

If [Michael Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson) was a web developer, he might make that song.
