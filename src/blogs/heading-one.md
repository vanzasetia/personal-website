There must be one `<h1>` element on every page of your website. You must not have two of them. Having two HTML heading one elements is like having two titles for a story. A story should only have one title. If it has more than one title, the writer is abnormal.

The HTML heading one element (`<h1>`) must exist on every page because it is the most visible title on your page. The `<title>` markup is less visible to users because it is available on the tab of a browser. Also, the text within it is for search engine bots. But the `<h1>`'s text is for your users.

The heading one should act as a title of your page. This means it should not be used for your logo. It should not be used to make the biggest text on a page. If you want to make text big, use CSS instead of the heading elements. It should not be used for anything other than a title.
