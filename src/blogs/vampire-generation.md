I hate dark rooms for reading.

What are the reasons for people not turning on light?

- "Too bright!"
- "It's hot! The lights make too much heat in this room."

People like vampires. They hate lights so much that they will not turn on the lights, even when they need to read books or see the whiteboard.

This happens in the library. Why do they love dark reading rooms?

I do not understand this phenomenon. In a room for reading, people do not turn on the light. Usually, old people are the one who turn on the light. (I am still young, you know.)

Young people around me love dark rooms.

A dark room means the lights off and the curtains closed. The light of the sun is not able to get through. There is barely light in the room. You can still read a book. But doing that will not be comfortable.

What is going on? Are they vampires?

I am always the person who turns on the light.

Is that a trend for having a room without enough light? Is that a way for people to save electricity? I do not understand why people around me love dark rooms.

Are those young people too lazy to switch the light on? I do not know. But what they are doing is damaging their eyes.
