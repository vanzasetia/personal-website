I got an email. In short, the email is the following:

> I hacked your computer a while ago. Now I have access to all your data and webcam. I even know that you watched controversial videos. Do not call the police.

This article is a reply to this dumb hacker or cracker. ("You" here refers to the dumb cracker.)

Thank you for telling me that you hack my computer. What a good evil person!

First, by sending me an email, you give me a clue about who you are. You emailed me in Vietnamese, a language that I do not understand. That means you are a fool. You do not even know the language I understand.

:::aside For your information
I did not translate the whole email. I knew from the beginning that it was a scam email because it used the Hotmail domain which is dead now.

Second, you claimed that you could access all my data. Really? Why don't you prove it? Tell me everything that you know about me. You do not even dare to tell my computer's operating system. You are just an ignorant person.

Third, you claimed that you have access to my webcam. Prove it! For example, send a picture of me. By the way, what if my computer does not have a webcam? Then, whose webcam do you have access to?

Next, you mentioned controversial videos. What do you mean by "controversial videos"? Like what? Could you please be more specific? Do you mean a video about [Kamala Harris who keeps saying "unburdened by what has been"](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=j6qzYdGwQBY)? Since you sent the email around the 2024 United States election time, maybe that is what you meant.

Lastly, I agree with you that I should not call the police. I will be a fool for trusting such a stupid threat. Every claim you write does not have any proofs. Instead of reporting to the police, I write this article to make sure that my readers who get similar email does not get fooled by an ignorant person like you.

## Lessons

Now, my readers, here are some lessons:

- Do not let that kind of email fool you.
- Do not reply to the email.
- Do not click any links from it.
- Search the email on the Internet by copy-pasting several sentences to your search engine.
- Write an article about it. (Optional)

:::note Do you want to read the email?
I already deleted the email. Then, after some time, I decided to write about it.

If you, my readers, want to know about the email, I found that [an article from MalwareTips](https://malwaretips.com/blogs/i-gained-access-to-your-devices/) explains a similar email I got.
