In public speaking, the goal may be to influence people. But the real goal is to make yourself confident with what you will say. If you do not even feel confident in what you say, how do you convince others?

In marketing, the goal is to make money. But the real goal is to sell something useful to other people. If you sell useless products, nobody will give you moneyâ€”unless you can hire someone like [Lisa](/blog/labubu/) to promote them.

If your goal is to get lots of like-minded people as a writer, your real goal is to share your thoughts and to connect with other writers.

**The real goal is something within your control.** You can make yourself convinced with what you say. But you have no control over whether others will feel convinced. You can make useful products. But you can not force others to buy them. You can share your thoughts and interact with other writers. But you can not guarantee that others agree with you.

Different person has different real goals in achieving a goal. Find your hidden and personal goal to achieve your goal.
