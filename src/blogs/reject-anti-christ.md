If you are a Christian, do not use the term "Xmas." Use "Christmas." There will be no Christmas without Christ.

If you are a Christian, do not just say "Happy holiday" on Christmas day. Say "Merry Christmas."

If you are a Christian, do not use the name of our God, Jesus Christ, as a form of mockery. Never. Do not follow what you see on television or movies by using "Jesus" when mocking someone else. Remember the seventh rule from the Ten Commandments, Exodus 20:7:

> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain (21st Century King James Version (KJ21)) (You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord, Bible in Basic English (BBE))

Be aware of the propaganda that people use to hate Jesus. If you are a Christian, reject all the anti-Christ propaganda.
