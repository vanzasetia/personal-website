The [anti-Christ](/blog/wrong-rally/) people, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, are out of the White House. Bye!

No more [homosexual flag in the White House](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-accused-us-flag-code-violation-pride-month-display).

As someone who is not an American, I can not respect [a country that invites transgender people](https://www.newsweek.com/topless-trans-woman-white-house-pride-outrage-1806151), dancing like idiots, to a very important place which is the White House in this case. If you have common sense, would you invite those crazy people to your house? I will never invite them to any place, let alone my home.

Open border has become a history, a horrible history. People came to America illegally. Most of them were destroying America. Now those evil people will be deported.

Imagine what Kamala Harris and Joe Biden felt when [Trump was delivering his inauguration speech](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=IFvLorAL5-8). They must be suffering. They should feel ashamed. But I do not believe they feel ashamed anyway. I can not expect evils to feel bad for their evil doings.

President Trump is now cleaning up the wickedness and all the dirty work from Biden and Kamala.

I hope the censorship in social media will be less than ever.

I hope my Christian brothers and sisters in America will see the price go down and many other improvements.

May God bless all American Christians! I hope you all, especially Christians, will have a better and safer country.
