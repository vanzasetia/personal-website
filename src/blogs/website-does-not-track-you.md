I do not want a website to track me. I also want to treat you like that.

I want you to know that I care about your privacy with a simple notice: this website does not track you.

I have three reasons to add that notice:

- I intend to respect your privacy.
- I like websites that states they do not track their visitors.
- I hate both essential and optional cookies for tracking visitors.

Now, if I do not add that notice, how do you know that I value your privacy? I do not have a good reason to hide my decision to respect your privacy.

If you have a website and care about your visitor's privacy, how do you show that you decide to respect other's privacy? People will not know your good deed if you do not show it.
