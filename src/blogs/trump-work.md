I know this video has been available for a while: [President Trump Addresses Joint Session of Congress, March 4, 2025](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=XkFKNkAEzQ8).

But I like that video. Trump *really* showed the works of those evil Democrats.

- Democrats tried to [change the gender of rats](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/yes-biden-spent-millions-on-transgender-animal-experiments/).
- Democrats had registered millions of people with unbelievable age numbers to Social Security.
- Joe Biden and Kamala Harris loved criminals entering the United States of America.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris had done many other evil things. But I do not want to make my website a list of their wicked actions.

My favorite part is when Trump mentioning the total number of people with ridiculous age. **There was one person listed at 360 years old**. I thought, "Joe Biden has not been mentioned. I wonder why he did not register himself."

Now the Democrats have been going crazy by destroying Tesla toy cars (and real cars too). They are stupid. But at least they *can* do [a very complex movement](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=B56dIepzB0w). They must have been practicing extremely hard for *probably* four years.

Recently, Trump has announced a list of tariffs for lots of countries: [Major Trump announcement on worldwide tariffs](https://yewtu.be/watch?v=f7eiuPaABCI). I am not an economist, so I can not say anything. But The White House wrote an article that [tariffs work](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/tariffs-work-and-president-trumps-first-term-proves-it/).

All of these show that Trump is working to fix his country. Meanwhile, the Democrats are losing their mindsâ€”do they even have a brain in the first place?
