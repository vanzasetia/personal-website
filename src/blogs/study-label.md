A long time ago, my sibling was learning to drive a car. My father stuck a piece of paper behind the car that had the word "Study." The purpose was to tell other drivers that the one who drives the car is still learning.

One day, the car's machine stopped working in a traffic jam. I was with my parents and my sibling. It was noon so the weather was really hot. Usually, people will be getting angry so as they pass by our car, they shout, "Why do you stop?!" But what actually happened was nobody shouted at us, and some people were giving advice on what to do when they were passing by. My father told me we were lucky because we had the "Study" sign.

People treat you based on your label. When it comes to programming, that is the same. If you say that you are an expert, but the results of your work are not as expected, people will be disappointed. If you are a beginner, people will act friendlier and more tolerant of the mistakes you have made.

When I was in high school, the teachers often expected me to understand what they explained. So they often asked me questions. If I could not answer the question, one of my classmates would say, "If Vanza can not answer it, then it is impossible for us." If I could answer the question, the teacher would say, "Look, Vanza understands what I explained, why don't you understand it?" Somehow, my teacher and my classmates made me a judge.

The taller the tree grows, the stronger the wind blows. Decide. How do you label yourself?
