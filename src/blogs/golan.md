Golan was a well-known student for having bad marks in all subjects. He had the worst marks in his class. People labeled him as a dumb student.

One day, one of his friends was sick and needed to be taken to the hospital immediately. The teacher and some of his friends got into a car. But, the driver was not available due to an illness. Then, Golan asked to become their driver. Since they had no other options, they let Golan drive the car.

In the end, they all managed to go to the hospital. The one who was sick passed away. The rest of the people, including Golan, were hospitalized.
