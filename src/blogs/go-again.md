{{ description }}

The last time I published an article was in June 2025. That was a long time ago. Now I still love that article. Some people still love to [torture themselves by playing a video game](/blog/video-game/). They get scared. But they still want to play the game. They get angry, and they still want to play it.

I really like this:

> Some people play games as if they want to torture themselves.

Probably, they do not mean to torture themselves. But if you watch videos on YouTube, they are really getting tortured and shouting insanely.

They are probably exaggerating their reactions to get attention or to keep the audience engaged. Maybe. But if you are not a YouTuber, what's the purpose of playing a video game if you get scared or angry? You destroy your mood.

Anyway, I am back now. I want to share the changes that I have decided on this website.

- I will focus on sharing tips about writing and web development. I really want people to accept that writing can be hard and that they can cope with it. The same goes for web development. It can be challenging. But we can do it. We can become great web developers.
- I am not going to teach you how to get a job. That is not my purpose. But I want you to get better at writing and developing a website.
- Before, this website was meant to help me get a job. Now, I mainly do not use it to get a job. It is just a place for me to help as many good people as possible. One thing that does not change: I do not help bad people.
- Before, this website was not colorful. Now, it is colorful because I want to learn to use colors. I get bored with black and white colors. There is nothing wrong with using only two main colors. But that makes me use the `border` property a lot. With different colors, I can avoid this website having lots of lines.

How can those changes help you, a great web developer, to learn web development?

- To be a teacher, I need to prove myself. If I do not do what I say, I am a bad teacher. I need to keep improving myself. This is why I tell you things as they are. I do not want to be a hypocrite.
- I am passionate about web accessibility and writing to make an accessible website with great content. An accessible website makes it easy for people to use your website. It also helps you make money if you monetize your website. Great articles will help people to find a reason (or more) to keep visiting your website. By the way, great content is also a part of making an accessible website. The reason is that we all can make an accessible website, but if people can find a reason to care, nobody will visit your website, which makes your website inaccessible.
- I hope the variety of colors on this website helps you to keep engaged. If you are not a color blind person, I hope this helps you find what you need on this website more easily. If you are a person with color blindness, don't worry.

I hope, soon, I can monetize this website. I need money just like everybody who lives in reality—it's normal. I am still a college student. I am nobody—no shame at all. If you can [donate](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/vanzasetia) to me, that would be greatly appreciated.

One more thing: if you fail, **go again**. Don't give up.

See you on the next great article.
