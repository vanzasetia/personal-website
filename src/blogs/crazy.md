{{ description }}

I want to share with you to show you how stupid humans can be. I hope that you learn something so that you will not do any of these stupid things. If you have done one of these, better stop now.

I can not write every stupid action or idea that humans have done or come up with. But at least, I cover the most relevant ones. Get ready to see the insanities of humans!

## Warning

**You will read disturbing content. Some links contain images that you may find disturbing. Reader discretion is advised.**

## Gothic people

If you search on the internet about [gothic fashion (disturbing content)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ghotic+people&ia=images&iax=images), you will see people wearing black clothes. There is nothing wrong with wearing black clothes. But when people put a ring on their nose, they are idiots. On their ears, they put a bunch of decorations. They also put lots of things in their mouths. How stupid they are!

I found a quotation while browsing gothic fashion:

> Fashion is not necessarily about labels. It's not about brands. It's about something else that comes from within you.
>
> —Coco Chanel

I think Coco Chanel has nothing to do with gothic fashion.

But I agree with Coco Chanel. In this case, people who harm themselves for the sake of fashion are mentally ill. Something inside comes from those sick people. They are stupid. They are empty. Yet they believe that having a ring on their nose shows that they have something. Yeah, they have a mental illness.

Those idiots may say, "Gothic fashion allows people to express their individuality." There is nothing wrong with expressing individuality. But doing harm to oneself is wrong. When they hurt themselves to express themselves, they are certainly mentally ill. Or they are stupid.

## Body modification

Body modification, here, refers to an act to change one's permanent look without any need to save one's life.

People who spend lots of money on surgery are stupid. They change their face. They do not have a medical urgency to do face surgery. But because of their stupidity, they decide to make a horn.

Hold on. That is not enough. Those people also decided to do tongue splitting. They want to be a snake. I wonder how they can eat with such a tongue.

Just search for [body modification (disturbing content)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=body+modification&ia=images&iax=images). You will see lots of aliens. If [aliens existed](/blog/alien/), they would look better than those people. Actually, people who do body modification are the real aliens.

[Jessy Kirkpatrick](https://www.dailystar.co.uk/real-life/body-modification-addict-unrecognisable-old-29702158) is a great example that I find easily. She, *sorry*, they, *oh this is wrong*, **she** was looking fine and beautiful. Now she looks like Satan. Actually, Satan looks even better than her. She has successfully become the weirdest woman that I have ever seen. Great job, Jessy.

I can not force other people to stop what they are doing. But, I can say my opinions about what they have done with their body. Let me write this for those who do body modifications: **you are an idiot.**

Even if those people feel regret later, that is too late. They can cry as much as they want. But they can not revert. This is why we need to think before doing anything like that. Think hundreds of times!

Never do this stupid thing.

## Homosexuality

Sex is a pleasure for those horny people. They do not see sex as a way to reproduce. They want to feel joy only. Homosexuality gives them a reason to have sex for fun.

Homosexual people love to make a victim narrative. They feel intimidated. In fact, nobody intimidated them. They feel insecure because deep in their heart, they know that homosexuality is wrong. When Christians tell them that they are wrong, they get angry with us. They go crazy.

Those homosexual people make their own church. Yeah, they make a church for the devil.

I found a stupid article on the internet: [10 Reasons God Loves Gay Christians](https://time.com/2842044/gay-christians/). By reading the title, I said to myself, "Well, there is nothing wrong with being *happy*." But I was wrong for sure.

For your information, the term "gay" referred to "happy" in the past. It was not meant to address a male homosexual person.

Now, we can assume that the number one reason is the best reason. To win in a debate, you need to put your best argument in a strategic place. In this case, the first reason should be the best.

Here is the first reason:

> The term “homosexual” didn’t exist until 1892.

Genius! I did not expect that when I first read the article. But a dog is still smarter than the author.

What a stupid reason! If the term does not exist, does that mean the act of homosexuality did not exist? The author is very stupid. I have a better reason. The term "sin" did not exist at one time. This means people can not commit sin until the term exists. Do you see the stupidity?

Moreover, the reason has nothing to do with God loving gay people. The author is so stupid.

We just got started with the first reason, and we can not find a sign of intelligence. I do not want to waste your time. But you can read the whole article for your entertainment.

Know that God hates sin. [An act of homosexuality is a sin](/blog/gay-pastor/). People who commit sins and do not repent are hated by God. Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed because the people are wicked.

Homosexual people, repent now! Stop following your lust! But if you insist on being a homosexual person, be ready for the consequences.

## Transgender

Transgender people are mentally ill. A girl tries to hide her breasts with a tight elastic binder. A boy tapes his penis and scrotum together behind his legs. How can a person decide to harm themselves? Transgender people, for sure, are mentally ill.

If you are a transgender person, you need serious treatment.

## Terrorists

Killing innocent people for the sake of God is an act of terrorism. But we, Christians, do not get surprised by that because the Bible has told us:

> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
>
> [John 16:2, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2016%3A2&version=KJV)

[Tens of thousands of Christians in Nigeria has been killed](https://aleteia.org/2025/04/22/200-christians-killed-in-a-week-nigerian-bishop-laments-ocean-of-blood). Those [Christians have been killed by those Islamic terrorists](https://www.persecution.org/2025/04/16/54-christians-killed-following-palm-sunday-service/). Those terrorists are not humans. They are the devils.

I feel sad. I wish I could do something.

By the way, does [Black Lives Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) care about those Christians? They are busy with the ["Trump 2028" hats](https://blacklivesmatter.com/ugly-merch-for-ugly-politics/).

## Religions

Religions are bussiness. Those religious leaders use the teachings of God to ask for donations. "If you donate to me, I will pray to God so that your sin will be forgiven," said a religious leader. Not to mention YouTube's super chat or selling merchandise. Those fake religious leaders become rich by fooling people.

More importantly, evil people use religions to fool others. Ignorant people will get fooled by their leaders because those people do not read their books. In a church, [a priest](/blog/gay-pastor/) can say that LGBTQIA+ is biblical, and millions of Christians will believe in that. A pope can say that [all religions are paths to God](/blog/pope-francis/). Ignorant people will follow the pope or anybody blindly.

If you are a Muslim, read your Quran. Do not believe in everything that your Sheikh tells you. You need to find the truth yourself. The same goes for others—Buddhists or Hindus.

By the way, Christianity is not a religion. It is the teachings of Christ. It is not based on a concept or a collection of ideas. Christ was a real person, not an idea.

Christians follow the truth only because the truth will set us free.

Jesus said to us:

> Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
>
> [Matthew 7:15, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%207:15&version=KJV)

Christians should **test everyone**, including the priests.

> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
>
> [1 John 4:1, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%204%3A1&version=KJV)

If someone claims to be a religious person, see the fruits. If the person promotes sin and abomination, you should know that this person is the devil.

> Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.
>
> [Matthew 7:20, King James Version](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Matthew%74%3A20&version=KJV)

## Hippies

Hippies are selfish people who love having fun. They have fun without limitations. They love having sex. They have sex with another's spouse. They do wife swapping and group sex. Even worse, they are willing to kill their babies—or to do an abortion. They drink alcohol. They get drunk in the street. They dance and wear nothing in public. They are insane.

Cynics are the same as hippies, by the way. They are selfish. They want to be free like animals. I think they believe that they are animals. If they do not, they act like animals anyway.

## Sex diseases

I believe sexually transmitted diseases are the most disturbing images. I hate them. But for the sake of education, I study a bit about them. This way, I have strong reasons not to engage in a free sexual relationship. Since the consequences are too big, I prevent myself from being a horny dog to jump on any women that I find.

You should educate yourself, too. By just seeing the images, you will feel disgusted to even think about sex. You might vomit. Be careful when you search the images, though. You will see tons of disturbing pictures.

## Tattoos

A tattoo is a sign of stupidity. A person decides to be a canvas for another person. Stupid! Why do people want to do that? Do they look cool? No, they do not. They look pathetic, and some even look horrible.

When people realize that tattoos are nothing, they have no way to remove their tattoos. Those tattoos become a permanent label telling others that **once upon a time, they were stupid.**

## Plastic surgery

Unless you have a medical urgency, having plastic surgery is stupid. Do not waste your money on such a thing. Be grateful.

## F-words

You think you are cool by saying those f-words (or f-bomb)? Your mouth is dirty. If being dirty is cool, you are cool. You are a cool person with a filthy mouth.

## Lefties

Let us go to the United States. There, you can find a sexual party, not a political party. What is that party? It is the Democratic Party. They call themselves Democrats.

Woke people are part of the Democrats. They are like hippies. Woke people and hippies are lefties, actually. LGBTQIA+ people are the Democrats, including the supporters of LGBTQIA+.

I found a video with the following title from Sky News Australia: [Lefties Losing It: The View’s Sunny Hostin thinks Pope Leo XIV is black](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKYjiu2a8PM). I do not watch the video. But I am not surprised when those idiots say that [Pope Leo XIV](/blog/new-pope/) is black. No surprise at all. Even Kamala Harris is black for them. I believe that their eyes are superior. Their brain has a very high Intelligence Quotient (IQ). But monkeys are still smarter.

Joe Biden, a stupid president, [celebrated Easter and proclaimed Transgender Day of Visibility at the same time](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/churches-lgbtq-groups-celebrate-transgender-day-visibility-easter-sunday-drag-me-to-church). He had shown no respect for Christians. He is an [anti-Christ](/blog/reject-anti-christ/) for sure, just like [Kamala Harris](/blog/wrong-rally/). He is a Democrat. What can we expect from a Democrat? We can expect a sexual agenda.

I am not saying that the Republican Party is 100 percent correct. But I say that the Republican Party is 100 times better than the Democratic Party.

## Stupid trends

You will find many disgusting actions on social media like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube. I never use TikTok, by the way. But I can know stupid trends on TikTok because people around me use it.

Do you know [Labubu](/blog/labubu/)? The last time I checked the official store, the dolls were out of stock. People have been going crazy to buy the ugly dolls just because a famous female likes the dolls.

Additionally, I once saw a video on a social media showing a woman using a cheese grater. She sat on top of a table. Then, she used the cheese grater to grate her left heel. Can you believe it? Under her left heel, there was a plate of food. What a stupid woman!

I did not see that because I searched for it. Someone showed that video to me, and I said to that person that the woman is stupid, and you are poisoning yourself by watching such a thing. The person was just laughing. I knew that this person did not take my words seriously. But I had done my part—telling this person that watching such videos is harmful.

Now, I need to stop. I can not keep writing about the madness of human beings. Not to mention the history, I can not write everything. I hope you learn something new.

Let me know what you think.
