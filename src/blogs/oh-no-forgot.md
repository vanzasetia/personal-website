When you want to travel, you need to make sure that you bring all the essential things for your needs.

One way to make sure you bring those important things is by **thinking about what you need from your head to your feet.** For example, starting from your head, you need shampoo and probably a hat. Going down to your eyes, you may need to bring sunglasses. Next, your mouth needs a toothbrush and toothpaste so that people do not run away from you. You keep doing that until you reach your feet.

I hope this little tip helps you to ensure you bring everything you need. Happy traveling!
