Trump, the current President of the United States, has lied many times.

Before he even got elected, he made many ridiculous claims. He claimed that [he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=GSE728iurSQ)—a video link to Invidious. This is stupid.

Even more ridiculous statement from him:

> I will get it [Russia-Ukraine war] settled before I even become president if I win.

—Donald Trump at a [presidential debate](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=wFW8_8YIpYE), a video link

The war is still happening. He was making jokes.

He recently has said on [X](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1892242622623699357) and Truth Social that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is "a modestly successful comedian." Who is the real comedian here? I know that Trump was a [comedian](https://redirect.invidious.io/watch?v=wZPrrLve2Eo)—another video link. Is he trying to be a comedian again?

I wonder. What is going on with Trump? Is he taking a side with Russia? Is he upset because [Zelenskyy rejects a stupid deal](https://nypost.com/2025/02/17/world-news/zelensky-rejects-trumps-demand-for-half-of-ukraines-rare-minerals/) to have 50 percent of Ukraine's rare earth minerals?

I understand that American people have no better choice. Either the witch, [Kamala Harris](/blog/wrong-rally/) or the comedian, Trump. During election time, if I were an American citizen, I would still vote for Trump. At least, he understands that [transgender people—fake women—should not be allowed in women's sports](/blog/common-sense/).

I hope that the American people do not support Trump blindly. Criticize him when he does something wrong.
