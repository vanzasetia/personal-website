Abortion is always wrong, regardless of the reasons. The reasons include being pregnant because of rape victim.

Why is abortion wrong? For us, as Christians, we can read [Luke 1](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%201&version=KJV). In verse 45, it says

> For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
>
> â€”Luke 1:45, King James Version

When Mary greeted Elizabeth, the baby inside Elizabeth's womb leaped because he knew that within Mary was the unborn Jesus. Mary was in the early stages of pregnancy. But the unborn John the Baptist knew about the unborn Jesus. This means any unborn baby was a living being. Thus, unborn humans should not be killed.

Those who claim to defend the human rights but support abortion are hypocrites. They do not support the right to life for the unborn baby. Isn't that unborn baby the most vulnerable? Why do they kill the most vulnerable life?

If women argue that they have the right to do whatever they want to their body, I say to those women, "You have no right over the body of your baby. Your unborn baby is not your body."

More importantly, how come animals do not kill their unborn babies? Have you ever heard an animal do an abortion? Even animals show more love to their babies than women who have abortions.
