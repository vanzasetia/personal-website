                  Hundreds of personal websites look pathetic. They do not have
                  content. The owners of the websites are probably not content.
                  Let me tell you this: putting a smiling face on your website
                  does not show that you are happy.

                  This course empowers you to develop a website that truly
                  represents who you are, while also providing valuable insights
                  for self-reflection and personal growth.

              <h3>Developing the personal website of your dreams</h3>
              <p>
                You will learn how to get the most out of yourself. Do not blend
                with the crowd. Let us make sure that your website truly
                reflects your personality and shows your uniqueness.

            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Both practical and theoretical knowledge</h3>
              <p>
                You will learn from my experience in developing a personal
                website. I will tell you about my experience, which often has
                immediate, useful impacts. Also, you will get the underlying
                principles that can be applied to a wide range of scenarios.
                With both practical and theoretical knowledge, you will get the
                full understanding of how to face challenges and solve problems.

              <h3>Encouraging active learning</h3>
              <p>
                Unlike other courses, this course does not baby you by telling
                you every step and every answer to all questions. I understand
                that you have unique experiences and strengths. This course
                offers you options, but you choose your own way.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h3>Plain English writing</h3>
              <p>
                I hate confusion. I do not like reading texts with overly
                complex language. I believe that when you understand quickly and
                fully, you can immediately apply what you have learned.

              <h3>Learning modern web development</h3>
              <p>
                This course is written with fresh content that promotes modern
                best practices. You do not need to care about Internet Explorer
                users. I do not want them to be my users. But if they visit your
                website, you still welcome them.

            <div>
              <h3>Building a strong foundation</h3>
              <p>
                This course discusses many misconceptions in web development. If
                you think HTML is easy, you are mistaken. Spending money on
                Udemy is a bad idea. I can keep going, but I want you to know
                the truth.

                  I have browsed the web intensively for over five years. I have
                  seen so many websites. In this course, I want to share my
                  experience as a user and a web developer.

                  I have never been contaminated by corporate culture. The
                  knowledge I give you is pure. I will not confuse you with
                  jargon.

                  Unlike social media, which has censorship, personal websites
                  are where people show their real and best selves.
