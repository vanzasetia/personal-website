{{ description }}

I am a Christian. I love my brothers and sisters in Christ. I want to connect with you. I want to learn the Bible with you. I do not want to learn the Bible from non-Christians. If I learn Christianity from non-believers, that is the same as learning about Christ from anti-Christ, which does not make sense at all.

Here are some key points that I believe and do:

1. Jesus is God. **Jesus is the King of Kings**. **Jesus is King of Kings**—not just a king. I believe in the Son, the Father, and the Holy Spirit.
1. The Bible is the best book I have ever read. God gives us His wisdom so that we can have a good life.
1. Abortion is totally wrong and is an evil act. All women who do abortions are baby killers. They are killers.
1. I hate LGBTQIA+. I hate the ideology they have. They are confused people. Their brain only thinks about sex and bathroom.
1. I do not like birds in a cage. I prefer those animals to be free. I prefer seeing animals in the care of a good owner who allows them to do what they need to do. Do not jail animals unless they need to be protected. Animals must be taken care of correctly with care and love.
1. I consume vitamin D3. Vitamin D3 helps me to stay healthy. Before I knew vitamin D3, I fell sick once a month and needed to consume drugs. Now I rarely fall sick. If I fall sick, I can be healthy without taking any drugs. (I will not say that I recommend you drink vitamin D3 because I am not a doctor.)
1. All people matter. All people’s lives matter because we deserve to live well. Thus, I hate Black Lives Matter. It is racist. It does not care about the black people at all. Does it care about [the Nigerian Christians getting slaughtered](https://brusselssignal.eu/2025/10/some-black-lives-do-not-matter-black-christians-slaughtered-in-nigeria-no-one-cares/)? (Spoiler alert: no, it does not and it will never care about them.)
1. Christians must be united so that nobody dares to takeover us. The division is the work of the devil. Christians must be together. We need to be together because we are strong together.
1. I do not hate capitalism. Making money and gathering money from our hard work is not wrong. When we do not worship money and have ethics, capitalism is a neutral system. But I do hate people who are willing to do everything to make money. They are evil.
1. [Digital Restrictions Management (DRM)](https://drm.info/) takes away people’s freedom. Formally, it is known as digital rights management. They take away people’s rights. That is a very bad management.
1. [Apple’s Liquid Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGztGfRujSE) does not have enough contrast sometimes. I do not have an Apple device. It is very expensive.
1. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is not easy. Syntactically, it is easy. Other than that, it can be hard and tricky.
1. Understanding web accessibility reveals how to write correct and good HTML code. Otherwise, valid syntax becomes the only guideline.
1. I support President Trump. I agree with 95% of what he has done for his country. Now I am sure that Democrats do not love me because I do not support the gender fallacy or LGBTQIA+.
1. I support Ukraine. The war between Russia and Ukraine is really bad because both are Christian countries.
1. I support freedom of speech. If we all have it, we can *respectfully* express our disagreement honestly without any fear.
